                The nearest station is Oval (not Kennington, as the name would suggest). Please arrive from 11.45am, and no later than 12pm. <b>The first centre pass will be at 12.15pm.</b>

              <p>One of our team captains is a level 3 coach and will be running a short rules session for tournament participants who need a refresher. If you've not played for a while or worried you don't know the rules fully, <b>come on down to the courts at 11am</b>, and join a whistle-stop session of the main dos and don'ts, including how to shoot or defend.</p>

              </header>
              <p>There are various public transport strikes planned for this weekend, but the tournament shouldn’t be too badly affected. Tubes are running as normal from 8am (apart from partial closures on Bakerloo and District lines), and London Overground and the Elizabeth are running a reduced service.
                National rail strikes are the main order of the day on Saturday, so check <a target="_blank" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/strikes">https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/strikes</a> for more info if you use these services, and plan your journey in advance.</p>

                <p>Stay safe out there!</p>
              </header>
              <p>Please make sure all your team members have read our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wI0S5v8qKsoRy6eDdBa8yR7-STc6RqEAk5ASMLxopEU/edit">code of conduct</a>, and arrive with short nails, hair tied back and all jewellery removed or covered up. We also have a few first raiders on hand, and two first aid kits. Hand sanitiser will be available for anyone to use on the registration desk and at the tuck shop.</p>

              </header>
              <p>All games will have two umpires, and will consist of two 7 minute halves with a 1 minute break at half time. Each team will be given their own games schedule on the day - please make sure your players are ready to start play promptly at the start of each fixture. As we were unable to avoid some teams playing two games in a row, there is a five minute break after every second game - so those teams affected have time to make changes, grab a drink etc.</p>

              </header>
              <p>We will have a tuck shop, where you can buy water, bananas, energy drinks and other goodies. We accept card as well as cash too! While we do have a tuck shop, we aren't allowed to serve 'proper' food on the courts. So, we recommend you bring a light lunch to have during the breaks to keep your energy levels up. We will bring bin bags for waste and recycling. </p>

              </header>
              <p>We are also running a raffle on the day, with some fab prizes, including tickets to events, an array of netball-related items, and a very special star prize, which will be unveiled on the day! Please encourage your teams to buy lots of tickets, so we can raise loads of dosh for the club, and also our partner charity for this event, <a target="_blank" href="https://lgbtiqoutside.org/">The Outside Project</a>. Tickets can be bought by cash or card. </p>

                <p>Apply that sunscreen!</p>
              </header>
              <p>
                The forecast the day before says it’ll be 24 degrees and partially cloudy - so at least we’ll get some respite from the heat of the last few weeks. That said, forecasts can change, so do check it on Saturday morning and prepare accordingly if needed.
                The courts are very exposed with little shade, so we recommend hats for when you’re not playing, as well as sunglasses and sun cream. During breaks, you can of course venture into the park for some shade - just don’t be late for a fixture!

              </header>
              <p>After the tournament (about 5pm), we’ll be heading over to The Cock Tavern (approximately a 10 minute away) to award the tournament prizes and have some drinks after an epic afternoon of netball. They don't serve food but they have said we can order from UberEats/Deliveroo so we can refuel.</p>

              <p>
                For those who wish to party on into the night, we also have a space reserved at <a href="https://zodiacbar.co.uk/" target=”_blank”>Zodiac Bar and Club</a> near Warren Street from 10pm. Zodiac is our club sponsor, and are a fab queer space for everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community, plus allies - just like us! We love them because of how truly welcoming they are to everyone, and their themed nights are next level.
                So if you’re up for going "aat aat", we hope you will join us to party into the night with our friends, who have supported us behind the scenes for a while now.
